Remote Copilot lets you access your VS Code GitHub Copilot from any browser, on any device. It brings real-time, context-aware AI coding assistance to the web—without relying on Remote Desktop or a local IDE.

Built with a custom VS Code extension, a Node.js backend, and a web interface, the system securely connects your browser to your VS Code workspace, enabling remote prompts, Copilot responses, and file-level actions based on your active code context.
